## Explanation

> Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Facade design pattern is used to help client applications to easily interact with the system.

Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. 

We can use Factory pattern with Facade to provide better interface to client systems.

## Advantage

It shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components.
It promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients.

## Usage

* When you want to provide simple interface to a complex sub-system.
* When several dependencies exist between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
